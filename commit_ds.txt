feat(ui): Modular Design System with reusable components

Architecture:
- New design-system/ folder for reusable components
- Centralized color configuration in colors.ts
- Type-safe metal, rarity, grade, and category constants
- Breaking change: Old CoinFilters replaced with CollectionSidebar

Design System Components:
- MetalBadge: Element-symbol style (Au, Ag, Æ) with size variants
- MetalChip: Selectable filter chip with count
- GradeBadge: Temperature-scaled colors (cold→hot)
- GradeScale: Visual temperature scale component
- RarityIndicator: Gemstone-inspired (dot/badge/full variants)
- RarityLegend: Shows all rarity levels
- PriceTrend: Price with change percentage and trend arrow
- SimplePriceTrend: Compact trend indicator
- Sparkline: Unicode block chart for trends
- PlaceholderSparkline: Loading state sparkline

CoinCard Redesign:
- Category-colored left border (4px)
- Hover state with quick actions (Edit, Expand, Share)
- Price trend with sparkline in footer
- Metal glow effect for precious metals on hover
- Mock price data placeholders until real API ready

CollectionSidebar (New):
- Search with keyboard shortcut hint (⌘K)
- Collection stats: total value, MoM change, avg grade, best ROI
- Sparkline for value history
- Metal chips with counts
- Category bars with distribution visualization
- Year range histogram placeholder
- Alerts section with dismissible notifications
- All filters from previous CoinFilters

Breaking Changes:
- CoinFilters.tsx removed, use CollectionSidebar instead
- Design-system components should be imported from @/components/design-system
